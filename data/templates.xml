		<body>Dear {$authorFullName},

Thank you for submitting your paper "{$articleTitle}"

I am delighted to inform you that your revised manuscript is now officially

My comments are the following:
{$editorCommentsToAuthor}

To begin the production process, our formal procedure is as follows:  

* Please be sure that your paper is in manuscript format (not the two
column Statistical Science style), with one-inch margins all around.
Please see a recent issue of Statistical Science for a sample
reference style format.

* Make sure that your article has an abstract and key words and
phrases. LaTex files are preferred (be sure that they will compose
without requiring external files), and MS Word and WordPerfect are
also acceptable. Encapsulated Postscript files (.eps) are preferred
for artwork but we will also accept .tif and .gif files.

* Please send your manuscript and source files to the publisher. Send all files mentioned above via email along with a PDF or PS file generated from your final source files to                                                                                                                          
                sts@mattsonpublishing.com 

If your message cannot be delivered due to the size of the attachments please send the files to mps-production@comcast.net.

* The reference number for your manuscript is {$transmittalNo}. Please use this
number in all future correspondence regarding your manuscript.
For each author, please provide the following information:

  o Name
  o Title
  o Affiliation
  o Complete mailing address
  o Email address

and please identify the corresponding author.

I encourage you, if at all possible, to pay publication charges.
More information will be included with your page proofs.

You should expect to receive the galley proofs of your paper about
4 to 6 weeks after the typesetters have received the final version
of your manuscript. Please be sure to notify Mattson Publishing
if you will be away from your mail address for an extended period
when the galleys are expected to arrive.

Once again, I offer my congratulations on an excellent contribution
to our journal. I appreciate your interest in publishing in
{$journalTitle}.


Sincerely,
{$editorFullName},

		<body>Dear {$authorFullName},

Thank you for submitting your paper "{$articleTitle}" for 
possible publication in {$journalTitle}.

It has now been carefully reviewed and I have concluded that 
it is not suitable for {$journalTitle}.

As you may know, Statistical Science is a review journal. We publish
articles that review statistical methodology or applications, with an
occasional history piece. The methodological reviews typically look
at a fairly broad class of methods (for example, generalized linear
models), while the applications review would cover the subject matter
in depth, in addition to the reviewing the statistical methodologies.

Science, please see http://www.imstat.org/sts/.
